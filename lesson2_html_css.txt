Lesson 2

[HTML/CSS/DOM]
	HTML Tag	- The browser turns HTML tags into elements that form a tree (DOM). 
				- Element = <tag> content </tag>
				- The type/name of tag decides what element will be created.
				- A tag can have attributes with values (e.g. <h1 class = "article")
				
	CSS:		- Decides the style the page will be presented with.
					<h1 class = "article"> ... </h1> means "all h1 elements that belong to the class 'article' should have the following style."
				- The HTML document can provide the browser with information about what CSS file to use and the location of the CSS file.
	- In order to assign a style to an element, assign a class attribute.

[CSS]
	- Styles can be assigned by tags or classes.
		- p { attribute: value} # This is for tags
		- .class { attribute: value} # This is for classes
		- * # Wildcard character, applying the style to all elements in HTML
	- Attributes
		- display # Changes the layout
		- max-width # Values can be either percentage or px

[Validation]
	- Validate markups or css, to make sure they comply with the standards
