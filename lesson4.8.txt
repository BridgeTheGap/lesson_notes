[Databases]

1. Tables (similar to Core Data)
	- Comprises columns and rows.
	- Columns are the type of data stored (Definition of the type of data).
	- Rows are an entry of that data.

2. Types of databases
	- Relational(SQL Tables):
		- PostgreSQL
		- MySQL
		- SQLite
		- Oracle
	- GAE Datastore
	- Dynamo (by Amazon)
	- NoSQL
		- Mongo
		- Couch

3. SQL (Structured Query Language)
	- A language for expressing queries
	- Invented in the 1970s
	- Example:
		SELECT * FROM links WHERE id = 5;
		"SELECT *"		Fetch data from all columns
		"FROM links"	Which table to fetch from
		"WHERE id = 5"	Constraints (which rows to return)

4. Tables, Indexes, and Trees
	- Table: "CREATE TABLE table_name FROM (column1 type1, column2 type2, ...)"
	- Inserting rows: "INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (value1, value2, ...)"

	- Index: "CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name(column)
	- Looking up a table takes longer than looking up an index (hashtable)

5. ACID
	- Atomicity: all parts of a transaction succeed or fail together
	- Consistency: the database will aways be consistent
	- Isolation: no transaction can interfere with another's
	- Durability: once the transaction is committed, it won't be lost

	# Examples of failure to achieve ACID in Monetor
	- Atomicity: Money is withdrawn from, but not deposited to
	- Consistency: Same transaction sometimes fails
	- Durabiity: Transaction data is lost


6. GAE Datastore
	- Entities
		- similar to tables
		- columns are not fixed
		- all have an ID field (manual/auto)
		- parents/ancestors
	- For further information on GAE Datastore, refer to lesson4/guestbook
